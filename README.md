# Things to do in Silicon Valley
----

## South Bay

Menlo Park, Palo Alto, Mountain View, and surrounds.

### On Campus at Stanford University

Walk through Stanford - especially along the oval

Rodin Sculpture Garden

Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden (in front of Roble)

[Climb onto a building's roof](http://www.quora.com/Stanford-University/What-are-the-most-interesting-secret-places-on-the-Stanford-campus/answer/Ben-Newman)

Sneak into the Frost Ampitheater at Night

Sneak into the Old Chemistry Building (supposedly seriously scary)

The men's bathrooms next to the History Corner and Languages Corner

> During the school year, these are almost always unlocked. Imagine the swankiest public bathroom you can, and now make it Chamber-of-Secrets-esque. They look like funny little huts from the outside, but inside they're pretty amazing. I don't want to give too much away, but there's a lot of funny/raunchy legends about these places. People even throw parties in them sometimes.

The Whisper Circle next to MemChu

> One of my favorite Arillaga gifts. It's on the right side as you face the front of the church, and just looks like a sort of circular bench area. Go stand in the middle of the circle, and speak out loud to hear what happens.

Arizona Cactus Garden

> President Henessy's favorite place on campus

### Palo Alto, Evening

Hookah Bar (though the staff aren't the nicest which often kills the vibe, unfortunately)

Any bars on University

Stanford Theatre

Ice skating at the [Winter Lodge](http://winterlodge.com/) (closed during Summer)

Rooftop hot tub at the Four Seasons: Supposedly there is a waterfall! This sounds pretty epic.

> Visiting the rooftop hot tub at the Four Seasons. It has really intense and pretty lights, and the pool is super warm. And there's a waterfall! A hot waterfall! It's totally romantic -- or, if you want to go with someone who's just a friend, that's totally fun, too. Because why are pools so beautiful?

> You can go about this a few ways. Either just walk in and take the elevator to the 4th (I think?) floor. Or, if that would make you feel guilty, start out at Quattro, the bar/restaurant downstairs. After a $16 cocktail or two each, you'll probably feel a more justified -- plus, why not make a night out of it? Or, if you're a real goody two-shoes, you could actually just get a room for the night, depending on your budget.

Sensory Deprivation Tank (e.g. [Float Bay Area](http://floatbayarea.com/))

### Slightly Further, Evening

Dave & Buster's: 33 minute drive. Expect to spend around $20 on food and $30 on games.

Movies: Redwood City

Go Karting: Gokart Racer in Burlingame is great. Other places have much worse reviews. Roughly $50pp.

Paintball: Santa Clara Paintball. Roughly $50pp.

### Evening Pretty

Joseph D. Grant County Park. Head to Quimby Rd, and look for a spot to stop and look out of the San Jose area. The view is amazing!

Climb the observatory at Stanford. Technically trespassing. Amazing view. 

Foothills Park. Go to the end of Alexis drive ([Gmaps](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Alexis+Drive,+Palo+Alto,+CA&amp;sll=37.369501,-122.17469&amp;sspn=0.003377,0.008256&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Alexis+Dr,+Palo+Alto,+California&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=37.368934,-122.175792&amp;panoid=65nmiYOK6QzLzwjiu90DoA&amp;cbp=12,142.98,,0,4.24)).

> Just leave your car by that gate, hop over it, and walk up to the hill you can see in the attached image.  Not only will you be able to see the stars, but also all of the Bay Area beneath you, and you'll also be the only people there, cause it's not a very popular spot.

Duck Pond in East Palo Alto

### Date Activities

_Note: All of the other items could also be date activities._

Contra dancing

> 5. Contra dancing. Omg! YOU HAVE TO TRY IT! It's a New England folk dance that's sort of like line dancing, but different. No experience is required -- just show up on time for the free lesson and then dance the night away. TRUST ME. You will love it. You will laugh. And it will be awesome. You won't (and shouldn't) dance with each other the whole time... but after messing up a lot and wondering what the heck is going on, you'll be thrilled to be back in each other's arms. The Palo Alto Contra Dance people meet at the United Methodist Church (it's just the venue, though -- the event is not religious) from 7:30-11pm on the 2nd, 4th and 5th Saturdays of each month. People of all ages attend and are welcome. There's a caller to make sure you know what you're doing... and there is always live music.

Go to a Spa: Watercourse Way seems highly rated

> I used to be a huge Verde fan (taro milk tea or taro freeze)... until I discovered Tea Era's roasted barley milk tea.  Since then, it has definitely replaced Verde as my favorite boba in this area.

> My personal favorite is Fantasia (Cupertino Village), followed by Verde (Mountain View). General consensus among my group of friends are that Verde has better pearl, but Fantasia has better tea... Also, don't forget to order half-sugar in Verde; they're super sweet.

> I've tried Tea Era and Tapioca Express too, but I like them a lot less.

> I recently discovered Ocha Tea Cafe on El Camino and Grant. They make the tea fresh using an expresso machine, just like the way the best places do it in Taiwan.

> Roasted barley and roasted oolong at Tea Era
> Everything else at Verde
> Only Taiwanese popcorn chicken at TapEx
